you can assign several classes to each element

background image using css:
div with a class like fill-screen
backgroud-image:url(....);
background-size:cover;
background-position:center;

setting the height of that div with javascript/jQuery
add script block to bottom of page.

$(function () {
  $(window).on("load resize", function () {
    $(".fill-screen").css("height", window.innerHeight);
  }
});

defines a function for the jQuery ready event, which attaches event handers to onResize and onLoad

if we want it to remain static, set
  background-attachment:fixed;
